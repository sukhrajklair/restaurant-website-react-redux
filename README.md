# Restaurant website - Front End Client
This project implements a front end client for a reastaurant website using React, React-router, Redux and Fetch. Most of the data presented in the final commit of the website is asynchronoulsy fetched from a server, which might be un-necassary and only implemented to understand the concept of asychronous data-fetching and combining it redux actions. The website also contains some rediculous animations which were also part of the exercise.
